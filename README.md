## let and const Exercise - Quiz

- What is the difference between ***var*** and ***let***?
  - The difference between var and let lies within their scope. var is function-scoped which you can access the variable anywhere within the function, whereas let is block-scoped, meaning you can only access the variable within a block.
- What is the difference between **var** and ***const***?
  - The difference between var and const is the ability to redclare variables. While var allows you to redeclare variables, const does not-you can only declare a variable once. const is also block-scoped.
- What is the difference between **let** and **const**?
  - Once you declare a value in const, you cannot reassign the variable. With let, you can reassign the value as many times as needed.
- What is hoisting?
   - All function declarations (using the function keyword) are hoisted to the top of their scope, either global or function. This means you can call a function before it's declared in the code and it will still work.
